/**
 * Raw JNI surface to libnescore.so. Kept intentionally tiny and side-effect free.
 * All heavy work happens on the engine thread (see [NesEngine]).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: [ensureLoaded] must be called once at app startup before any
 * external method is invoked. The native library is NOT loaded in the init
 * block to avoid ExceptionInInitializerError crashing the whole app.
 *
 * Pull model: Kotlin calls [runFrame] to step the core, [getFrameBuffer] to
 * read the latest ARGB frame (fallback), and [readAudio] to pull stereo PCM
 * for AudioTrack.
 *
 * Hardware acceleration: call [setSurface] with a [Surface] to enable direct
 * ANativeWindow blitting — the core writes frames straight to the surface
 * buffer, eliminating the JNI copy + Compose Canvas redraw overhead.
